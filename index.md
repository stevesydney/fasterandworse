The year is 2021. We are in the middle of a global pandemic that has been going on since a year, the specter of death by disease haunting every aspect of life on earth. Even non-human wildlife has been radically affected as such life forms have been coming out of the forests, the streets being empty the world over, there is the largest global confinement for humans, ironically reminiscent of zoos for these wildlife, in every city and town since. Now that the humans are confined, the wildlife is freer. All the powers of the old have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter: working together to limit the viral exposure to the huddled masses, in search of a cure, a vaccine.

Death, decay and vaccines are on everyone's mind. No longer are we sure what to trust, who to turn to, which media sources to depend on for the stats. Humans don't get to see each other in person any more. Still no aliens. 

Time feels like moving all over the place with our quotidian life turned upside down by the merger of workplace and family place, and when all our future plans of travelling as tourists and up the corporate ladder are all up in the air. 

But what we do have are dreams of someday making death a thing of the past — our consciousness jumping body to body, or getting uploaded to the digital cloud so we one day even forget how to die, so we *really* meet each other in cyberspace touching each other’s uploaded bodies — of finally winning against the incessant force of entropy that eventually erodes everything away. Living will no longer be limited only to the still alive. Such are the imaginaries of the plastic perfect future that the social movement by the name of *extropianism* would claim to harbinger under its broader affiliation with transhumanism. 

## Finally, we are here
We are the Intropians, a critique of and commentary on the extropian movement bound up in its many tangents of thought that it evokes. 

Extropianism, as a social movement, is premised on the continual expansion of the human lifespan and the human potential. As an ideology, it seeks its legitimacy in the rapid advancements in science and technology of the last few decades, leveraging which, we will someday gain immortality. At a minimum, it promises to open up lasting improvements in our immediate physical reality, such as the slowing down of the human aging process. This movement has been materialized around cryogenics and life-extension initiatives, with the expansion of our quality of life by way of integrating the human with the technological artifacts in the form of of implants and prosthetics.  

Extropy — from which comes the term, extropianism — was coined by [Tom Bell](https://hpluspedia.org/wiki/Tom_Bell) and defined by [Max More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_More) in 1988 as “the extent of a living or organizational system’s intelligence, functional order, vitality, energy, life, experience, and capacity to drive for improvement and growth” In the [*Principles of Extropy*](https://hpluspedia.org/wiki/Extropian_principles#1993_Extropian_Principles_2.5) *by* Max More, there is emphasis placed on rational thinking and practical optimism. Extropians share an optimistic view of the future, expecting advances in computational power, life extension, nanotechnology and so on. Many extropians believe in a future where thanks to advances in biomedical technology, brain and bodies will be preserved by means of cryonics. 

The term, extropian was brought to life as an antonym of the scientific concept of entropy. This was in the sense of entropy being responsible for and the scientific cause behind the always-forward-moving arrow of time: going from past to the present to reach the future with no way to turn back time, while acting as the invisible hand that erodes things over time, that makes it easier to break than to make, that slows down lifeforms to its eventual deaths. Where this is entropy, there is the inevitable decay and death of all life forms, as per the second law of thermodynamics. Thus, extropy, as its *cure*, came with the promise of no-death by no-decay. 

> [...] the second law [...] is the irreversible process of dissipation of energy in the world. What does it mean to say, ‘The world is running out of time’? Simply this: we experience the passage of time by the succession of one event after another. And every time an event occurs anywhere in this world energy is expended and the overall entropy is increased. To say the world is running out of time then, to say the world is running out of usable energy. In the words of Sir Arthur Eddington, ‘Entropy is time's arrow.’
> <cite>Rifkin, J. (1980), Entropy: A New World View</cite>

Our new term, "intropy" is derived from the Proto-Indo-European, or <abbr title="Proto-Indo-European">PIE</abbr>, roots of "in" and "tropē" where the latter means "a turning, a transformation". So intrope could point toward the semantic cloud of such ideas as: turning inwards, an internal turn (an in-turn), a turn only for the insiders, a not so visible from the outside turn, turning within, an immanent turn, turning back its connotations to mean entropy (as it has the same <abbr title="Proto-Indo-European">PIE</abbr> roots *en+tropy* via the Old French, "en" meaning “in”) all over again but only after having lost its entropic innocence at the hands of (having gone though the phase of) extropy. 

To often we stampede any possibility of tangents in deep thinking to not waste time. That is no more a concern now that time itself has gone out of whack as our confined lives are so out of phase. Of what fruits will these many tangents bring forth to our strange new confined world if we no more judge these for not being linear enough, not enough strictly rational, not always having an end already in mind at our beginnings?

We bring forth a philosophy of, and a provocation for inquiring into death, decay, and the digital frontiers that aim to address these concerns which have made us the human beings that we have become since the dawn of civilization. We have a particular focus and a peculiar fascination in regards to the world of technology and tech-optimists, of which, *crypto* has been chosen to be a prime candidate for our analysis. The reasons will be clear in the next section.

As intropians, we ought to resist the temptation of falling for the game of oppositional camps as we position ourselves in relationship to extropianism. Just as post-modernists are not opposed to modernism, but what came as a response to it having had and still living, yet remaining unfulfilled in doing so, in the multiplicity that is modernism, so does intropianism feel more like post-extropianism (under the shades of post-transhumanism) rather than anti or counter or non extropianism.


## Encrypting death away

It has been well documented that the history of digital currency (pre-Bitcoin) was influenced by the philosophy of the Extropians. Many of the early cypherpunks were committed to extropian ideals and experimentation. For example, [Hal Finney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Finney_(computer_scientist)), who was deeply involved in the creation of bitcoin and received the first Bitcoin from Satoshi Nakamoto was diagnosed with 
*amyotrophic lateral sclerosis* (<abbr title="Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis">ALS</abbr>). Immediately after his death he was cryogenically frozen, as he requested, at Alcor Corps.

On a similar note, Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has donated a substantial amount of funds [to cryonic-oriented projects](https://breakermag.com/the-bitcoiners-who-want-to-defeat-death/). On Twitter, Buterin has been known to mention the fable of the [Dragon Tyrant](https://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html#:~:text=In%20the%20fable%2C%20people's%20expectations,of%20human%20suffering%20and%20death.) by [Nick Bostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom) to promote life-extension efforts.

The progenitors of digital cash were one of the first few subcultures who started to question how a kind of money could hold its valuation into the future irrespective of nation states coming to or going out of power. In the sense of a money that never dies, this acts as an economic manifestation of their drive to gain immortality.  They wanted the value of money to never cease/die, so Bitcoin became an instrument that could store value “forever” — once saved, it would never get unsaved, and hence its unquestionable faith in the logic of immutability. 

Immutability provided for the economic justification behind immortality, in more ways than one. The possibility of funding for life extension research with *crypto*, to having a form of money that keeps its value in the far future as to whenever one gets resurrected. This goes further as well towards sustaining incentive compatible mechanisms between the undead and the caretaker with regards to ensuring the perfect maintenance of one’s cryogenic cell long after one is dead. This is because caretakers can get their due from the resurrected with the *crypto*, provided the undead can be resurrected for only then, can they access the keys (for their funds) from their memories.  The rationale for immutability is in the theo-law-gic with regards to achieving immortality via resurrection.

This rationale is part of the larger system of belief that underpins extropianism in terms of a modernist project as evident in the movement’s preoccupations with “rationality” (game theory to solve world peace), “progress” (no time to waste, unless tomorrow is better than yesterday it has been a waste), “expansionism” (spread *crypto* far and wide), and “individualism” ('not your key, not your coin', instead of not your key, not your network) are one of the main driving factors behind this. 

In such modernist conceptions of the universe, as with the majority of western metaphysics, time is perceived in a linear manner, which means there is no turning back time, hence the forward arrow of time — being immutable. In this light, immutability is cryptic for immortality. Applying the tech lens to encrypt our inherited desire for immortality, and out comes on the other end the crypt, the cypher~~punk~~. This is manifest in the forms of immutability regimes with its associated cultures of protocol devs and influencers guarding all past confirmed transactions/records with all their lives, like from another time with the guards, chosen by G-d, standing at the gates of the ancient temple of Babylon for that is their life's work. 

> [T]hat principally there are no mysterious incalculable forces that come into play, but rather that one can, in principle, master all things by calculation. This means that the world is disenchanted. One need no longer have recourse to magical means in order to master or implore the spirits, as did the savage, for whom such mysterious powers existed. Technical means and calculations perform the service. This above all is what intellectualization means.

> [… F]or civilized man death has no meaning. It has none because the individual life of civilized man, placed into an infinite 'progress,' according to its own imminent meaning should never come to an end; for there is always a further step ahead of one who stands in the march of progress. And no man who comes to die stands upon the peak which lies in infinity. Abraham, or some peasant of the past, died 'old and satiated with life' because he stood in the organic cycle of life; because his life, in terms of its meaning and on the eve of his days, had given to him what life had to offer; because for him there remained no puzzles he might wish to solve; and therefore he could have had 'enough' of life. Whereas civilized man, placed in the midst of the continuous enrichment of culture by ideas, knowledge, and problems, may become 'tired of life' but not 'satiated with life.' He catches only the most minute part of what the life of the spirit brings forth ever anew, and what he seizes is always something provisional and not definitive, and therefore death for him is a meaningless occurrence. And because death is meaningless, civilized life as such is meaningless; by its very 'progressiveness' it gives death the imprint of meaninglessness. 
> <cite>Max Weber, <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/lfoster/2006-07/sosi3830/lectures/MaxWeber_TheDisenchantmentofModernLife.html">The Disenchantment of Modern Life, Essays in Sociology, 1946</a></cite>

With the modernist loss of enchantment, death has lost any meaning, it is now a scientific and technical problem to be solved like all things the modern *man* has to solve. 

This is not a total loss however, lest we forget that:

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
> <cite>Arthur C. Clark, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws">Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination, 1962</a></cite>

This is reflected in how those in the immutability regime are in awe of the protocol, intent on keeping all past transactions untouchable, like the sacred from ancient times. Precisely, the locus of enchantment has been shifted with modernity from the archetypal myths to the ~~(infinite money)~~ machines, for we still aspire to materialize the fountain of youth, we are far from giving up on our dream to be drunk on the elixir for eternal life. To ~~en~~chant, is to be human.

## Won't you play along?
We recognize that behind this assemblage of extropians tendencies and temptations lies dormant a deep desire — albeit faint in its expression, having been buried by years of getting older while fighting death in the process, in working towards the impossible imaginary of immortality — that desire of finally, eventually, after all said and done, putting your guard down, to be able to slow down, take one’s time, smell the flowers, enjoy the sunset. Only an immortal being can afford to loose themselves from time to time, for a long long time, for 200 or 2000 years in trivial pursuits even knowing that it is so without guilt or remorse. They be playing a wholly different economic game of affordances now that there's no scarcity in their time-to-live.

The advantage of immortality over mere life-extension is in this certainty that you can directly/personally with im-mediacy ~~(transcending intermediaries)~~ benefit from whatever you do right then and there without having to wait for the fruits of one’s action post death, that every living moment would amount to living one’s “life’s work”. In a stroke of poetic justice, #cancellingdeath out in the wake of becoming immortal, brings eternity down to be realizable in every ordinary moment of staying alive. This inner contradiction of *eternal everydayness* is the binding force (behind this impossible imaginary of immorality) that keeps the extropian faith alive and burning with the united desire of those faithful.

We keep reminding ourselves, that what could seem antagonistic to life, that being death, might be life fulfilling even and especially for extropians in spite of how extropians act and talk in rationalizing their stories and desires to themselves. Contradictions are abound when diving deep in life and the beyond. If we are not running into contradictions, we are not paying close attention. Praying that this will humble us as we chart the Intropian path ahead.

We, the intropians, are interested in exploring how these multiple threads intersect with each other in order to sustain the reality that is the extropian movement. We, the intropians, invite you on a journey through the colorful lands of <abbr title="Science and Technology Studies">STS</abbr>, anthropology, media ecology, politics, theology, and computer science to navigate the underbelly of this death defying dance that the extropians play.
