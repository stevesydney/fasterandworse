# Introduction

Everything is a process.

A process is a sequence of steps in which actors perform specific actions at specific times relative to prior steps or introduce new factual elements and process actors in the sequence.

All steps need not include the same set of actors, and the interaction between actors can be asynchronous as long as the interactions can be grouped together into sequential steps.

Additionally, any step can fork into multiple branches without any need to reconcile them into a single branch. There can be parallel steps in different branches if they are performed at the same time. As time always moves one direction, there can never be circular steps within the same branch.

Examples of processes can be found in almost every human to human and human to machine interaction. Just a handful of examples from this ocean include:
