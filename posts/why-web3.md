Why do we call it web3? A sequel, a successor, an evolution.

Why does it need HTML, CSS, and Javascript?

Why does it rely on Chrome or Firefox and browser extensions? 

Could it work without Google search?

Could it work without UX designers?

Could it work without the W3C?

Could it work without GAFA?

What if it isn't accessible with Chrome or Firefox?

What if GAFA has no presence there?

What if it is separate to the web?

What if it is powerful enough to be something completely new?
